## Getting Started

The purpose of this mini project was to demonstrate data integration of multiple data sources into the Azure Data Lake pipeline. 

### Why I used a Data Lake over a Data Warehouse?

- Data Lakes Handle unstructured to semiunstructured data types very well
- Data does not need to be structured to a set schema, thus can be read very easily and quickly
- Data is loosely structured in a lake, work can be very agile and changes can be made on the fly.
- Integrating new data sources is very easy, data does not need to be transformed prior entering the lake.
